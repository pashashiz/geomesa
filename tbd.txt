Note, to run individual tests which involve Accumulo minicluster pass -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true

1. Scala 2.12 support. Use collections compat.
2. Spark 3.x does not exist for 2.11 find a workaround (looks like there is already something in place)
3. geomesa-index-api Check why LocalQueryRunnerTest fails
4. geomesa-fs-spark-runtime relies on Hadoop 2.x where spark on 3.x hence test fails
5. geomesa-kafka-datastore relies on old kafka which relies on rocksdbjni with version 5.18.3 < 6.29.4.1,
  just bumping rocksdbjni does not help cause that is not compatible with current kafka version, so need to update kafka to 3.x
